        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li><span>2</span> and <span>1/4</span> cups (280g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><span>1</span> teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li><span>1</span> and <span>1/2</span> teaspoons cornstarch*</li>
            <li><span>1/2</span> teaspoon salt</li>
            <li><span>3/4</span> cup (170g / 12 Tbsp) unsalted butter, melted & cooled 5 minutes</li>
            <li><span>3/4</span> cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
            <li><span>1/2</span> cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li><span>1</span> large egg + <span>1</span> egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
            <li><span>2</span> teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li><span>1</span> and <span>1/4</span> cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chocolate chunks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span>Whisk</span> the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl.
                Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, <span>whisk</span> the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated
                sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. <span>Whisk</span> in the egg and
                egg yolk. Finally, <span>whisk</span> in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be 
                thin. <span>Pour</span> into dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon
                or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and appear 
                greasy. <span>Fold</span> in the chocolate chips. The chocolate chips may not
                stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine 
                them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Cover</span> the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 
                2–3 hours or up to 3 days. <span>I highly recommend</span> chilling the cookie 
                dough overnight for less spreading.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Take the dough out</span> of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly 
                <span>soften</span> at room temperature for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Preheat</span> oven to 325°F (163°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment
                 paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a cookie scoop or Tablespoon measuring spoon, <span>measure</span> 3 scant 
                Tablespoons (about 2 ounces, or 60g) of dough for XL cookies or 2 
                heaping Tablespoons (about 1.75 ounces, or 50g) of dough for 
                medium/large cookies. <span>Roll</span> into a ball, making sure the shape is 
                taller rather than wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies 
                bake up thicker. <span>Repeat</span> with remaining dough. Place 8–9 balls of dough 
                onto each cookie sheet. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Bake</span> the cookies for 12–13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly
                browned. (XL cookies can take closer to 14 minutes.) The centers will 
                look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool. <span>Cool</span> 
                on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, <span>press</span> a few extra 
                chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is optional and 
                only for looks. After 10 minutes of cooling on the baking sheets, 
                <span>transfer</span> cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cookies stay fresh <span>covered</span> at room temperature for up to 1 week.
            </li>
        </ol>
