        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose or plain flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup granulated sugar or sweetener</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda*</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda 
                and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, 
                slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before 
                slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until
                 smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).
            </li>
            <li>
                Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with
                a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the
                pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your
                ladle or measuring cup.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface,
                 flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!
            </li>
        </ol>
