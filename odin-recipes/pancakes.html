        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span>Combine</span> together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda 
                and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and <span>add</span> the milk, 
                slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a wire whisk to <span>whisk</span> the wet ingredients together first before 
                slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. <span>Mix</span> together until
                smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Set</span> the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Heat</span> a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with
                a little butter to lightly grease pan. <span>Pour ¼ </span>cup of batter onto the
                pan and <span>spread</span> out gently into a round shape with the back of your
                ladle or measuring cup.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface,
                <span>flip</span> with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Serve</span> with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!
            </li>
